## updates - mid-May 2018

- pagination now in! feelsgoodman.jpg üë®‚Äçüé§

## todo

- switch CSS to Sass - gotta get that dang node module working
- add more functionality to queries / figure out a reason to add redux

## suggestions from a friend to ponder:

1. Make the footer stick to the bottom of the page, or get rid of it. You only have one link there that could easily be in the header.
2. Should be able to filter the results by status at least. Filtering/sorting by most recent would be cool too.
3. Any reason why we can't see all of the results? Seems silly be forced to limit the results
